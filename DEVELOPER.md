# Install Node.js + Grunt For Windows

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

2. In your LiteCart project folder (next to package.json) create the file "Run Node.cmd" with the following content:

    @C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Program Files\nodejs\nodevars.bat"

3. Execute "Run Node.cmd" and in the command prompt type:

    npm install

Done! Node.js should now have installed all necessary libraries, you can now use any of the following commands:

    grunt         (Launches all grunt tasks)
    grunt less    (Compile and minify .min.css from .less)
    grunt uglify  (Uglify and minify .min.js from .js)
    grunt replace (Update version number in scripts from package.js)
    grunt phplint (Check scripts for syntax errors)
    grunt watch   (Watch for changes in .less and .js and update minified versions on the fly)
